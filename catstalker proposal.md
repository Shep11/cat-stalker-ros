## Leila Lyn Ryan / Cat Stalker:

###  SUMMARY: “What are we doing?” (1 paragraph)
Create a robot to play with cats automatically/manually so owners can leave the cats entertained when they leave. – Catstalker
### MOTIVATION: “Who cares?” and “How could this be valuable or useful?” (1-2 paragraphs)
Over 46 million houses in the US have cats [1]. Many of these people can unfortunately not be with their cats all day, making the cats bored, and bored cats break stuff. To minimize the damage created by these cats we must entertain them. In 2024, people spent 50$ on average on cat toys [2]. This shows that there is a large market for cat entertainment that our robot can be a part of. 
### CHALLENGE: “Why is this hard?” (1 sentence to 1 paragraph)
Our expected test cats are destructive. Noor is smart and will be suspicious of the robot. Cookie is not smart and will attempt to consume the wires. The robot will need to be made in such a way that its weakest components are not exposed.
### EXPECTED APPROACH: “How will we do it?” (1-2 paragraph)
Cats like chasing things so we are going to build a robot to exploit that fact. Our robot will be wheeled and run on its own. It will have a cat toy on a string that it can wave to get the cat’s  attention. We will also make it so it can be manually overridden and controlled by their owner on a computer.
### RELATED WORK: “What else has been done?” (1-2 paragraph)

This robot allows remote control with a phone to allow users to remotely play with their cats. It also comes with an autonomous mode. It includes video saving features to allow users to record and share videos of their cats. This robot uses a laser pointer to play with the cats unlike our design with uses a cat toy on a string.

This robot does not sense. It only actuates. It is similar to our design in that it uses an attached cat toy to entertain a cats hunting instincts. It does not allow the user to remotely interact with the cat.
